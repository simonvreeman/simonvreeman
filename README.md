### Hi there 👋

I am [Simon Vreeman](https://vreeman.com), and I like to buy domain names and build useless webpages for it. For example:

- 📖 [De definitie en herkomst van het woord Tachtien.](https://tachtien.nl)
- 📘 [Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Translations by Gregory Hays.](https://vreeman.com/meditations/)
- 📕 [Arrian’s Discourses of Epictetus.](https://vreeman.com/discourses/) Including the [Enchiridion](https://vreeman.com/discourses/enchiridion) and [Fragments](https://vreeman.com/discourses/fragments). Translated and edited by Robert Dobbin.
- 📗 [Moral Letters to Lucilium and Essays by Seneca.](https://vreeman.com/seneca/)
