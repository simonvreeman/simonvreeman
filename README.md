### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am [Simon Vreeman](https://vreeman.com), and I like to buy domain names and build useless webpages for it. For example:

- ğŸ“– [De definitie en herkomst van het woord Tachtien](https://tachtien.nl)
- ğŸ¥ƒ [Jenever in Amsterdam](https://jenever.amsterdam)
- ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡½ [Mezcal in Amsterdam](https://mezcal.amsterdam)
- ğŸ“˜ [Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Translations by Gregory Hays.](https://vreeman.com/meditations/)
- ğŸ“• [Discourses of Epictetus. Translations by George Long.](https://vreeman.com/discourses/)
