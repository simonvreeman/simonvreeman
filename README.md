### Hi there 👋

I am [Simon Vreeman](https://vreeman.com), and I like to buy domain names and build useless webpages for it. For example:

- 📖 [De definitie en herkomst van het woord Tachtien](https://tachtien.nl)
- 🥃 [Jenever in Amsterdam](https://418.ai/jenever)
- 🇲🇽 [Mezcal in Amsterdam](https://418.ai/mezcal)
- 📘 [Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Translations by Gregory Hays.](https://vreeman.com/meditations/)
- 📕 [Arrian’s Discourses of Epictetus. Including the Enchiridion and Fragments. Translated and edited by Robert Dobbin.](https://vreeman.com/discourses/)
